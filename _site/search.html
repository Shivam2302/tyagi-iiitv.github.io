However, you can directly jump to a phase in case you’ve prior experience in programming. Up to you !Phase 1: Learning the basics of programmingIn this phase, the main aim is to cover the basic paradigms of a programming language. I highly recommend that you start competitive coding in C, C++ or Java. These languages act closely to the compiler and you control more parts of your program easily compared to languages like python which does most of the basic handlings of the code by itself. This is an important part of the learning that you know how to have full control of your code.ResourcesYou can take any book that you like in your favorite language. I prefer the How to program series in your favorite language by dietel and dietel. This is the book to learn C programming.Some random adviceYou can try some practice on competitive programming websites but that’s not necessary at this stage. You should focus on finishing this stage as soon as possible because there isn’t much to work with algorithms.Phase 2: Polish your basicsIn this stage, you know all about using the fors and the ifs. That’s wonderful. Now you should start focusing on starting with algorithms and using your knowledge to do things the smarter way. I’ve some good resources for you to carry on in this phase.Resources  The hackerearch code monk series  is a boon to the beginners with all the lessons, practice and contests at one place. Follow the lessons and you’re good to go to the next phase.  For trying some extra problems on your topics, hackerrank is a good place to practice. They make the test cases available and you can see where your solutions go wrong.Tip of advice: To see the solutions to the problems without losing points on hackerrank, create accounts with two id’s and use one id to see the solution. However, you should only use this for learning and at least try working on the problem yourself for some time.Phase 3: The best blog to follow to gain expertise (topic wise).I’ve used this resource and I just loved it.The IIT Kanpur BlogSkim through the started portions and start solving the problems linked in this page in serial order. Don’t skip. Each problem is important in this blog.In case of help  I’ve a github repository  for the solutions to most of the spoj problems listed on this blog. However if you cannot find any and you manage to solve it on your own, please do fork this repo and we can help build up solutions to this amazing blog problems.  You can use spoj toolkit to check that your spoj solution works fine to several test cases before submittig.Start competingNow you’re in a great position to compete. Don’t be upset if you feel like you don’t know anything initially, this happens with everybody. What’s important is to note is that you check the best solutions and editorials for every contest problem after the contest ends. Yes ! Every problem, irrespective of whether you solved it or not. This will help you improve by leaps and bounds.Resources  This is a great plugin for your web-browser to know all the contests that’s happening or that are about to come. Check out Challenge Hunt.  Along with competing, you can also take a look at a more advanced course on Competitive programming at Stanford.Phase 4: Practice and CompeteWell finally, you know it all and now you’re able to understand that its practice and practice and practice that can help you reach your goal.

Comment on this post if you want the supplementary material for this paper.Here we consider 11 representative gut microbes:  B. thetaiotamicron VPI-5482  F. prausnitzii A2-165  L. plantarum WCFS1  L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363  S. thermophilus LMG18311  H. pylori 26695  K. pneumoniae MGH 78578  S. enterica subsp. typhimurium LT2  E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655  E. coli O157:H7 str. Sakai  E.coli O157:H7 str. EDL933The motive is to study the community behavior of these microbes pairwise and study whether their behavior lies in any of the following categories shown below:DetailsFour types of conditions that can appear inside the human gut are considered for the community behavior analysis of the microbes. These are:  No Oxyger and without gut enterocytes interaction: This situation occurs in the large intestine proximity at the center of the lumen.  No Oxygen and with gut enterocytes: This situation arises when the microbes get exposed to sloughed epithileal cells but still there is no oxygen because the microbes are far from the epithelial cell layer.  With Oxygen and without gut enterocytes: This situation occurs at the mid point of the lumen in the duodenum where some oxygen swallowed with the food is present. This is in proximity of the stomach.  With Oxygen and with gut enterocytes: When the microbes are close to the epithelial layer with oxygen dissipated by the enterocyte.      The below diagram represents all of the above mentioned cases.      Methods applied for simulations  Host and microbes were joined through a separate compartment (u) sim-ulating the intestinal lumen. This compartment served as an inlet fornutrients derived from the simulated diet and the enterocyte; it allowedmetabolite exchange between the microbes and provided an outlet forfermentation end products.  First the single models and then the community models were simulated in the above mentioned environments.  Each of these models were analyzed for three types of diets: Proteins, High fiber and Western.  The Western diet was high in sugar and fat content but low in fiber content.  The High fiber diet was high in fiber content but low in simple sugar and fat content.  The protein diet had twice the protein content compared to other diets and had low fat content with moderate simple sugar and fiber content.ResultsThe following graphs show the results obtained for each type of behavior based on 12 scenarios i.e. all the combinations of (three diets + With/Without Enterocytes + With/Without Oxygen).      Total outcomes predicted for 55 microbe pairs subjected to 12 scenarios.            Microbe behavior when paired in all combinations in 12 scenarios for simulataneous growth optimizations.            Microbe-microbe co-culture outcomes, resolved by diet, oxygen status and enterocyte presence/absence.      ",
