- ### Want to build your own website, download my jekyll website theme !!!
	- <a class="btn btn-success" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/Website-public-sample/archive/master.zip">Download my latest website code</a> OR <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/Website-public-sample">View code.</a>

	- It includes all the cool features like **Search, Tags, Categories and everthing else which you see.**

- ### Extract English text from Image and Translate to Hindi (Android App)
	- <a class="btn btn-success" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/ImageTextTranslator/blob/master/Sandroidocr/app/app-release.apk">Download the app directly</a> OR  <a class="btn btn-warning" id="margin_yes" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W58XR7Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1487492338&sr=1-1&keywords=image+text+translator+%28English+to+Hindi%29">Find it on Amazon AppStore</a> OR <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/ImageTextTranslator">View Code</a>
	
	- #### Read this before you open the app
		- This app requires Tesseract to work, so you need to create a folder named **SimpleAndroidOCR** inside the internal storage of your android device. Then, inside this folder, create a new directory named **tessdate**. Now copy the file [eng.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/master/eng.traineddata) inside the **tessdata** folder.
		
		- Make sure you've granted all the permissions to the app.
		
		- Make sure you're connected to the internet.
	
	- #### Features and usage example
	
		- On the first screen, clink on **TAKE PHOTO** on top of your screen.
		
		- Then you can click picture on any english text. Make sure you're close enough while clicking as the word should be clear.
		
		- Now a crop screen will open, you can crop **one word** which you want to translate and then click **CROP** at the bottom of the screen.
		
		- The extracted should appear in the text box on the next screen. Don't worry if it doesn't, it sometimes won't. You can manually enter the text at this point of time. 
		
		- Then click on Translate and the corresponding Hindi text will appear in the text box below.
	 
		- This is mainly for practicing how to connect Tesseract and Yandex Translate APIs to an android application.
	
- ### Pyopengl and Pygame example
	- `sudo pip install OpenglExample`
	
	- `$ python`
	
		`>>> from pyopengl_example.demo import demo`
		
		`>>> demo()`	
	 
	- <a class="btn btn-success" id="margin_yes" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenglExample">View on PyPi</a> OR <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/PyopenglExample">View code.</a> 

	- This is a simple app demonstrating how to render a *Blender* object into *pyopengl* and visualize it using *pygame*.	
	
- ### Book Sharing portal for IIIT Vadodara (Android App + Website)
	- This is the most comprehensive projects that I was a part of. Following proper software engineering standards, we built this project in a team of 10 members. I was a part of the Android App team.
	- <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/TheHackstreetBoys/BeyondBooks">View code.</a>
	- If you have access to IIIT Vadodara intranet, you can directly download the app 
	
		<a class="btn btn-success" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/TheHackstreetBoys/BeyondBooks/raw/master/androidApp/BeyondBooks/app/app-release.apk">Download the android app</a>
	
	- This portal has a book buy and sell facility. And not just that, you can also comment on any book, discuss problems in a particular books, tag people in your discussions and much more. So basically its a combination of three major features, **a discussion forum, a buy-sell portal and a book-rating portal**.
	
- ### Speed Breaker Predictor System (Android App + Django Server)

	- This is an experimental app and isn't packaged yet, as it is still not fully developed. However, to have a look at my Android and Django skills, you can have a look at its code. Or feel free to contribute (Let me know.)
	
	- <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/Bumpy">View code for Android app.</a> And <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/Bumpy_server">View code for Django Server.</a>
	
	- The server side is implemented with the help of *Django, Redis queue and the Django Rest Framework*.
	
- ### I'm also interested in Big-Data !! See my project on how to implement an inverted index using map reduce in Hadoop.

	- <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/Hadoop-Inverted-Index-using-Map-Reduce">View code</a>
	
- ### For the C-beginners, this is a good project sample. Check out my games which run on terminal !! (Yes, its all in C)

	- <a class="btn btn-info" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/cannon-combat">Cannon Combat</a> OR <a class="btn btn-success" id="margin_yes" href="https://github.com/tyagi-iiitv/frogger-in-c">Frogger</a>
	
- ### Signals and systems theory project, I built a guitar tuner in Matlab. It's very mainstream though !!

	- Still you can view the code to understand the use of **fft** in signal processing.
